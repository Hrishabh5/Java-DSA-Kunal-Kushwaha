- [x] Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 'Factorial'.
      Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ .... _ (n-1) _n. E.g.-
      4! = 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 = 24
      3! = 3 _ 2 _ 1 = 6
      2! = 2 \* 1 = 2
      Also,
      1! = 1
      0! = 1
